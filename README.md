# HelloWorld-Rust #

First program using Rust


## Run ## 
To run main.ms:
1. Navigate to it in terminal. In terminal, enter "rustc main.rs" (create executable)
2. If permission denied, do "chmod +x main.rs"
3. Do "./main"


## Branches ##

Each branch is a small exploration of Rust. <br> For example, the default branch is a classic Hello World program. The "iteration" branch iterates through a vector, printing its contents.
